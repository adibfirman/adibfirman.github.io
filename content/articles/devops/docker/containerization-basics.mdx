# Docker Containerization Basics

Docker has transformed how we deploy and run applications. Let's explore the fundamentals of containerization.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Build an image
docker build -t myapp .

# Run a container
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp

# List containers
docker ps
```

## Benefits

- Consistency across environments
- Lightweight compared to VMs
- Easy scaling and deployment
