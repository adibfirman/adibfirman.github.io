# React Hooks Deep Dive

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. Let's explore advanced patterns and best practices.

## Custom Hooks

```jsx
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(c => c - 1);
  
  return { count, increment, decrement };
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep hooks simple and focused
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Follow the rules of hooks
