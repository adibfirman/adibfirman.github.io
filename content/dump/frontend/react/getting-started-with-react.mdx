# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this article, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and create your first component.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

## Creating Your First Component

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

This simple component takes a `name` prop and returns a greeting.
